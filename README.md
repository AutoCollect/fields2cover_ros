## Pre-requisites

This code has been tested with ROS noetic and melodic.

First, install [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) and create a [workspace (from now: catkin_ws/ )](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace). 


Also compile and install the [Fields2Cover library](https://github.com/Fields2Cover/Fields2Cover).

Under `catkin_ws/src` clone the `rviz_satellite` and this package:
```
git clone https://github.com/nobleo/rviz_satellite
git clone https://github.com/Fields2Cover/fields2cover_ros
```

## Compilation

From the workspace folder (`catkin_ws/`), run:

```
catkin_make
```

## Running a demo

To run an interactive demo, run:

```
roslaunch fields2cover_ros view_field.launch
```

A rviz and a rqt_reconfigure windows will appear, so you can interactively modify the path created:
